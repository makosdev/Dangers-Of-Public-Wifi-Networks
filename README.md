One of the biggest risks of using public Wi-Fi networks is the potential for hackers to intercept your data. When you connect to a public Wi-Fi network, your device is communicating with a router that is shared by everyone else on that network. This means that if a hacker is also connected to the same network, they could potentially intercept your data and steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal identification.

Another risk of using public Wi-Fi networks is the potential for malware to infect your device. Malware is a type of software that is designed to harm your device or steal your data. Malware can be spread through a variety of methods, including through public Wi-Fi networks.
Tips for Staying Safe

# Here are some tips to help you stay safe while using public Wi-Fi networks:

 1.   Avoid accessing sensitive information while connected to public Wi-Fi networks, such as online banking or shopping.
 2.   Use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your data and protect it from potential hackers.
 3.   Make sure that your device is running the latest software updates and security patches to reduce the risk of malware infection.
 4.   Use two-factor authentication when accessing sensitive information, as this can help to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts.
 5.   Only connect to Wi-Fi networks that you trust, such as those provided by reputable businesses or organizations.
